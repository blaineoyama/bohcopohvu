非想天則 (Romanized: "Hisoutensoku", Meaning: "Lacking Perception of Natural Laws" or "Lacking Perception of the Rule of Heaven") is the eponymous character of the Tasofro fighting game Touhou Hisoutensoku. At the beginning, its existence was only known by the Goddess Suwako and her assisting Kappa. Hey! Hey you! Are you interested in getting into Hisoutensoku netplay? Do you feel your competitive spirit burning up, with nowhere to let it go wild? You wanna smash some buttons and maybe even get away with it? DO YOU LIKE 2HUS!? SAY. NO. MORE. Beginner Beatdown: Fighting Against Dropped Combos! As mentioned in the title, this is a tourney for those players who are still making their first steps into the world of Soku netplay. You will have the opportunity to face opponents I want to play it, but I don’t know where Hello, my name is Zaton, and I am here to introduce you to a one-of-a-kind fighting game. Before we get on with the main show, let's kick this thing off with a wonderful intro video made by Ichirin, a member of our community (BB players might find this one familiar) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DhPbsO1UuU What is Touhou Hisoutensoku? I believe that I should first explain what is Touhou in general; it is a franchise of bullet hell (or shoot 'em up) games, popular https://www.facebook.com/events/214927595667131/ (https://www.facebook.com/events/214927595667131/) It's everybody's ~~\(2nd\)~~ favourite fighting game Hisoutensoku, if you live in Singapore and fancy a small hangout, participate in the meetup at 20th May. gt Come down to our gathering at Singapore Polytechnic to play Touhou 12.3 Hisoutensoku with us! Of course, we would be doing other things other than just simply playing Soku such as other Touhou fighting games \(IaMP, SWR, AoCF, etc\). What does Blue Sky weather do exactly? When the Scorching Sun weather happens, does my damage increase when I shoot bullets from the air or can it still increase when I shoot the bullets from the ground then go in the air before the bullets hit my opponent. Hiya everyone! It's been a while since TL_soku has been able to bring you a soku tournament, so we'll be hosting one on the 22nd of February! The tournament is going to be a fun, casual tournament, and everyone is welcome to join. You can sign up for the tournament and read on all tournament info here. You will need to make a challonge account to join! (Don't worry, it's easy.) Please read EVERYTHING in the tournament description page so you know all the information. https://i.imgur.com/1CkZMqE.jpg Where can I get images for the background behind the character portraits. The only thing I really know about touhou's production is that it's created by something something called Zun. I found Hisoutensoku's sprite effects on spriter's resource, and although the person that ripped them said it's okay to use them, are they really alright to use? I don't plan on monetizing off of my game but I was wondering if someone could give some insight how where these effects are being ripped and who I should give credit. 
When I tried to search this music on Youtube I could only find remixes or videos that go on for 5 minutes(which loops the music and makes it play 2 times in a row). I know I'm just being picky here but I just want to know whether or not there is a video of the music playing for only 2:30 minutes. Want to know so I can understand what it means when the Dust Storm weather causes attacks to "Induce counter hit state". They've been out for 1h30 and no one has posted yet so I guess I should make the thread myself then Results from Big thanks to Drake for making the touhoudict translation tool ( I used on these results. --- Do you dislike reddit's tables? Good news for you: you can also check the results on TouhouWiki (https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/THWiki_Popularity_Poll) or Maribel's nicely formatted web page (https://maribelhearn.github.io. Hey there. A while back me and my bro got XBONE's so we could play Killer Instinct and a variety of other fighters since most were cross platform. I got a Hitbox since I used to play on my crappy laptop before it died. Unfortunately a majority of the non KI fighters we like (Blazblue, Guilty Gear, King of Fighters) decided THIS GEN to not be on xbox. is there a converter I could get that would let me use the box on a PS4? I have no electronics knowledge for taking apart and modding a board. There's a line from Touhou Hisoutensoku which says something about Sakuya manipulating parallel universes to summon a clone of herself. However, with the English translation, we don't know if she's actually creating the parallel universes or merely summoning versions of herself from another universe. I'd like the original Japanese version translated to confirm Sakuya's feats. 咲夜がもう一人現れ敵を攻撃する。本体が前に出るか、分身が前に出るかをボタンで選択し、互いに性質がやや異なる挙動になる。原理としては別時間の自分を云々。 English version's in this link: https://en.
